# Apachae Cassandra

> The [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) database is the right choice when
> you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance.
> Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure
> make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.
> Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class,
> providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.
