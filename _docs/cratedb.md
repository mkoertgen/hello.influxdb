## What is CrateDB?

From the [CrateDB-Website](https://crate.io/products/cratedb/)

> CrateDB is a distributed SQL database built on top of a NoSQL foundation. It combines the familiarity of SQL with the  scalability and data flexibility of NoSQL, enabling developers to:
>
> - Use SQL to process any type of data, structured or unstructured
> - Perform SQL queries at realtime speed, even JOINs and aggregates
> - Scale simply
>
> Customers often use CrateDB to store and query machine data. This is because CrateDB makes it easy and economical to handle the velocity, volume, and diversity of machine and log data. In fact, customers have reported CrateDB ingesting millions of data points per second, while also querying terabytes of data in real timeâ€¦ 20x faster than their previous database and on 75% less database hardware.

CrateDB is only available commercially, pricing information requires sales contact.
